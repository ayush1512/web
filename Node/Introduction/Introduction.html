<p>
  > Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web
  browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running
  scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
</p>

<p>
  Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming
  language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some key features of Node.js:
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>**Asynchronous and Event-Driven**:</b> All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It
      essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after
      calling it and a notification mechanism of Events helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <b>**Single Threaded but Highly Scalable**:</b> Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. This architecture
      helps in handling multiple concurrent clients with ease.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <b>**No Buffering**:</b> Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>**Package Ecosystem**:</b> Node.js comes with a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager) which provides access
      to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also assists in package installation, version management, and
      dependency management.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<br>

<p>> Node.js is used for a variety of tasks in web development, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>
  1. **Real-Time Applications**: Node.js is excellent for real-time applications such as chat, gaming apps, live tracking,
  etc. Its event-driven architecture caters to both the client-side and the server-side, which is ideal for real-time
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  2. **Microservices Architecture**: Node.js is a good choice for building and maintaining microservices. It's
  lightweight, fast, and scales easily.
</p>

<p>
  3. **APIs**: Node.js can be used to build fast and scalable RESTful APIs. It's non-blocking I/O model makes it efficient
  against concurrent requests.
</p>

<p>
  4. **Data Streaming**: Node.js has excellent support for streams, which are used to process data that might not fit into
  memory. This makes it a great choice for handling file uploads, real-time video or audio encoding, and similar use
  cases.
</p>

<p>
  5. **Command Line Tools**: With Node.js, you can build command line tools using JavaScript. This can be anything from a
  tool to automate your workflow to a full-fledged file system manager.
</p>

<p>6. **Web Scraping**: Node.js can be used to build web scraping tools to extract data from websites.</p>

<p>
  7. **Desktop Applications**: With frameworks like Electron, you can use Node.js to build desktop applications that work
  across Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
</p>

<p>
  Remember, Node.js is just a tool. The use cases mentioned above are not exclusive to Node.js and can be achieved with
  other programming languages and frameworks as well. The choice to use Node.js should be based on the specific needs and
  constraints of your project.
</p>

<p>
  > **Note**: Node.js is not a programming language. It is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. The
  language itself is JavaScript.

  <p>In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that serves as a blueprint for other objects. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is used to inherit properties and methods from.</p>

  <p>When you create an object using a constructor function or the `class` syntax, the prototype of that object is set to the prototype of the constructor function or class. This means that any properties or methods defined on the prototype are accessible to all instances of that object.</p>

  <p>Prototypes are used to implement inheritance in JavaScript. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the object itself has that property or method. If it doesn't, it looks up the prototype chain to find the property or method on the prototype object.</p>

  <h2>Here's an example to illustrate prototypes:</h2>
  <pre><code>
  // Constructor function
  function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  }

  // Adding a method to the prototype
  Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }

  // Creating an instance of Person
  const person = new Person('John');

  // Accessing the greet method
  person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
  </code></pre>

  <p>In this example, the `Person` constructor function has a prototype object. We add a `greet` method to the prototype, which is then accessible to all instances of `Person`. When we create a new `Person` object and call the `greet` method, it prints the name of the person.</p>

  <p>Prototypes are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and understanding them is crucial for effective object-oriented programming in the language.</p>

  <p>@workspace /explain What are node modules</p>

  <h1>GitHub Copilot:</h1>
  <p>Node modules in Node.js are a set of functions encapsulated into a single unit, which can be easily shared and reused. They are essentially JavaScript libraries or files that contain a bunch of functions you want to include in your application.</p>

  <p>Modules are a fundamental aspect of building applications in Node.js, as they allow you to include external libraries, such as database access libraries, or to create your own modules to organize your code.</p>

  <p>There are three types of modules in Node.js:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Core Modules: These are modules that come bundled with Node.js itself. Examples include `http`, `fs`, `path`, `url`, etc. You can use these modules in your application by requiring them, like so: `const fs = require('fs');`.</li>
    <li>Local Modules: These are custom modules created by the developer. They can be used to split your code into multiple files and folders, and can be required using the relative path to the JavaScript file. For example: `const myModule = require('./myModule');`.</li>
    <li>Third-party Modules: These are modules installed from the npm registry (Node Package Manager). Examples include `express`, `lodash`, `async`, `request`, etc. You can use these modules in your application by first installing them via npm (`npm install express`) and then requiring them, like so: `const express = require('express');`.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Here's an example of how you might create and use a local module:</h2>
  <pre><code>
  // In greet.js
  module.exports = function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }

  // In app.js
  const greet = require('./greet');
  console.log(greet('John')); // Output: Hello, John!
  </code></pre>

  <p>In this example, `greet.js` is a local module that exports a function. This function is then imported and used in `app.js`.</p>
